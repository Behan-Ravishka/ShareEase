3. **Access Methods**:
   - **QR Code**: Scan the QR code displayed on the main page

- üñ•Ô∏è **Smart TVs**: Any TV with a web browser

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Port Configuration
By default, ShareEase runs on port 5000. To change the port:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=False)  # Change 8080 to your preferred port
```

### Upload Size Limit
The default maximum upload size is 16GB. To modify:

```python
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 1 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 1GB limit
```

### Upload Directory
Files are stored in the `shareease_uploads` folder by default. To change:

```python
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'my_custom_folder'
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Network Discovery
The application automatically detects your local IP address and generates a QR code for easy access.

### File Management
- **Automatic Sorting**: Files are sorted by upload time (newest first)
- **Safe Deletion**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network and file system errors

### Security Considerations
- Files are only accessible on your local network
- No external internet connection required
- Files are stored locally on the host machine
- Consider firewall settings if having connection issues

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't connect from other devices?**
- Ensure all devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Check if firewall is blocking the connection
- Verify the IP address is correct

**Upload fails?**
- Check available disk space
- Verify file size is under the limit (16GB default)
- Ensure the upload folder has write permissions

**QR code not working?**
- Make sure your camera app or QR scanner is working
- Try typing the URL manually instead

### Firewall Configuration

If you're having connection issues, you may need to allow Python through your firewall:

**Windows:**
- Go to Windows Defender Firewall
- Allow Python through the firewall

**macOS:**
- Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall
- Add Python to allowed applications

**Linux:**
- Use `ufw` or `iptables` to allow port 5000
